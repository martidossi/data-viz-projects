Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

You're asleep, but still, I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along

Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
For a no-good bum like me
To live is to be free
Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

I can see your face in all of my dreams
Smiling, laughing from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try
You're all the reason for my life

Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down?
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have

Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd?
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can't stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they'd never shared our love

You can see her as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special

Because I know she's got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be

Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella (Just like Cinderella)

But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day

So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store

Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?

Baby, give me one more
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye

Yes, all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Yet it seems to make me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?

Baby, give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?
So dance while the music still goes on
It's going to be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own

With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...
But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle

Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

Baby, how could you do it?
You just told me lies
And you meet behind my back with other guys
Baby, how could you tell me
There was only me?
I was stupid to believe you, I was blind but now I see

Then you smiled and you took my hand
""There is something,"" you said, ""that you may not know
There's a couple of men in my life
And one of them is my brother Joe
He's been gone for a long, long time
But he's back and I think he's going to stay
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way""

On Top of Old Smoky

On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow
For courting's a pleasure and parting is grief
And a false-hearted lover is worse than a thief
On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow
Midnight Special

Well, you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding-dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Well, you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me

When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

Taken by surprise (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

What a crazy day (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
All my sense had flown away (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

Young and sweet, only seventeen

Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue

I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
The name of the game
I have no friends, no one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice

A voyager, and a settler, they both have a distant goal
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
I've always tried""

Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on

I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive
Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on


The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on
Like a wind that's always blowing

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me
I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing

Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss

Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still, it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare, baby, and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

It's elusive, call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone

I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there

Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight

You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere

And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""

And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play


And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

7,Super Trouper by ABBA,1980-11-03,14,12,Put on Your White Sombrero,"Put on your white sombrero
Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset
You'd better go for there is no
Place for you here

Like an old fashioned hero
You stand before me
Oh, you think our life is a movie
My world is real I live and feel
And I can do without you


Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandanna too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend, this is the end
For me and you

Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night, all dressed in white
Unchained and free, without me
Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Go find a sweet señorita
Somebody meek, who'll never speak
Harshly to you

You're such a caballero
Proud, never bending
I want someone who will take me
Just as I am, I need a man
Who is in rhyme with his time

8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,1,The Visitors,"I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up

These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming, through the door I feel I'm

8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,2,Head Over Heels,"I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace

8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,3,When All Is Said and Done,"Here's to us, one more toast, and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done


It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done

Do I see the signs I think I see?
Or is this just a fantasy?
Is it true that the beast is waking
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight
In the pale moonlight?

In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble?
Won't somebody tell me what I hear
In the distance but drawing near?
Is it only a storm approaching?
All that thunder and the blinding light
In the winter night
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing

8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,5,I Let the Music Speak,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep, the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when the day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",16,

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

That's how I started the show, one of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know
One of us is crying, one of us is lying

8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,7,Two for the Price of One,"He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they had nothing to say (Nothing to say)
At least not until the day (Till that day)
When something special he read
This is what it said:

""If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)""
He called the number and a voice said, ""Alice Whiting""
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat (Meet for a chat)
The three of us in my flat? (In my flat)
I can't forget what I read""
This is what it said:

""If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one

8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,8,Slipping Through My Fingers,"Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go?
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers


Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",16,
8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,9,Like an Angel Passing Through My Room,"Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",16,

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on, the usual way, he's such a clever guy
Then I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?
Strange how dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)

And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me, here I am, my arms are open wide

Somewhere in the middle of the never-ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose a lot
Come, make your own contribution to this melting pot

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars
And the people, the air that you're breathing is me
Yes, I am the city, you let me be
People feed me with their lives, I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind, if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars

Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep

Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no

8,The Visitors  by ABBA,1981-11-30,18,17,The Day Before You Came,"I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

""Ett, två... ett, två, tre...""

Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Like a diamond glittering in the sky
Seems to me you shine your light
Down to me to say goodnight
Twinkle twinkle, my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the Milky Way
From afar
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star
Another Morning Without You

Raindrops on a windowpane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you
Curtains rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes its way into my mind
Coming through
Yet another morning without you
An Angel Walked Through My Room

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Mmm...
Echoes of a voice I knew
An Angel Passing Through My Room

Half awake and half in dreams (Half awake and half in dreams)
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
An Angel's Passing Through My Room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room
Like an Angel Passing Through My Room

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my roomEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",16,2012 deluxe edition (The Final Album) bonus tracks
