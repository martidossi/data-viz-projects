🖊️ This repository contains the Python notebooks used to collect and prepare data for my data visualization projects. 
Subfolders are named according to the corresponding work in my **Behance portfolio**: https://www.behance.net/martinadossi.

📉 **Data** are all available in the dedicated folders: from the input data sources to the intermediate and final results.

▶ **To run the notebooks**, after having cloned the repository, install the required libraries from the root directory by running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
