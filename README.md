# data-viz-projects

This repository contains the Python notebooks used to collect and prepare data for data visualization projects. 
Each subfolder is linked to a project in my Behance portfolio: https://www.behance.net/martinadossi.


ðŸ“‰ **Data** are all available in the dedicated folders: from the input data sources to the intermediate and final results. 
â–¶ **To run the notebooks**, after having cloned the repository, install the required libraries from the root directory by running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
